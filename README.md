PoomSmart's headers
===========

A collection of headers used by most of PoomSmart's tweaks, meant to be used with his fork of [theos headers](https://github.com/PoomSmart/headers).

Setup
======

Make a folder named PSHeader containing all headers outside of your project folder. Also create PS.h header file that contains this line `#import "PSHeader/PS.h"`.

Usage
======

In your tweak source code, `#import "../PS.h"`
